Assignment: Python Functions, Loops, and String Operations
Problem 1: Count Vowels
Task: Write a function count_vowels(s) that takes a string s as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

Problem 2: Reverse a String
Task: Write a function reverse_string(s) that takes a string s as input and returns the string reversed.

Problem 3: Sum of Even Numbers
Task: Write a function sum_of_evens(n) that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).

Problem 4: Palindrome Check
Task: Write a function is_palindrome(s) that takes a string s and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward) and False otherwise.

Problem 5: FizzBuzz
Task: Write a function fizz_buzz(n) that takes an integer n and returns a list of numbers from 1 to n with the following rules:

For multiples of 3, add "Fizz" instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, add "Buzz" instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, add "FizzBuzz".
Problem 6: Capitalize Words
Task: Write a function capitalize_words(s) that takes a string s and returns the string with the first letter of each word capitalized.

Problem 7: Character Frequency
Task: Write a function char_frequency(s) that takes a string s and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string.

Problem 8: Generate Fibonacci Sequence
Task: Write a function fibonacci(n) that takes an integer n and returns a list containing the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

Problem 9: Remove Duplicates
Task: Write a function remove_duplicates(s) that takes a string s and returns a new string with all duplicate characters removed.

Problem 10: Factorial Calculation
Task: Write a function factorial(n) that takes an integer n and returns the factorial of n using a loop.

Submission Guidelines:
Save each function in a separate .py file with the function name as the filename.
Ensure that your code is well-documented with comments explaining each step.
Include test cases for each function to demonstrate its correctness.

Assignment: Python Functions, Loops, and String Operations
Problem 1: Count Vowels
Task: Write a function count_vowels(s) that takes a string s as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Use a for loop to iterate over the string.

Problem 2: Reverse a String
Task: Write a function reverse_string(s) that takes a string s as input and returns the string reversed. Use a while loop to reverse the string.

Problem 3: Sum of Even Numbers
Task: Write a function sum_of_evens(n) that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). Use a for loop to iterate through the range.

Problem 4: Palindrome Check
Task: Write a function is_palindrome(s) that takes a string s and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward) and False otherwise. Use a for loop to compare characters.

Problem 5: FizzBuzz
Task: Write a function fizz_buzz(n) that takes an integer n and returns a list of numbers from 1 to n with the following rules:

For multiples of 3, add "Fizz" instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, add "Buzz" instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, add "FizzBuzz".
Use a for loop to iterate through the range.
Problem 6: Capitalize Words
Task: Write a function capitalize_words(s) that takes a string s and returns the string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Use a for loop to iterate through the words.

Problem 7: Character Frequency
Task: Write a function char_frequency(s) that takes a string s and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string. Use a for loop to iterate through the string.

Problem 8: Generate Fibonacci Sequence
Task: Write a function fibonacci(n) that takes an integer n and returns a list containing the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Use a while loop to generate the sequence.

Problem 9: Remove Duplicates
Task: Write a function remove_duplicates(s) that takes a string s and returns a new string with all duplicate characters removed. Use a for loop to iterate through the string and a list to track seen characters.

Problem 10: Factorial Calculation
Task: Write a function factorial(n) that takes an integer n and returns the factorial of n using a loop. Use a while loop to calculate the factorial.
